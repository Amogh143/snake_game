snake game using java
If you are a â€˜90s kid or an adult you have probably played this game on your phone. The goal of this game is to make the snake eat the tokens either without the snake being touched to the boundary on the screen or its own body. Every time the snake eats the token the score is updated. The player loses when the snake touches the boundary or its own body and the final score is displayed.
Functionalities:
1.	Snake can move in a given direction and when it eats the token, the length of snake increases.
2.	When the snake crosses itself, the game will be over.
3.	Token will be generated at a given interval (30 seconds).
